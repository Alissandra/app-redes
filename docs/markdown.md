# Markdown Review

### 1) To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

### 2) Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

### 3) Headers
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

### 4) To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). Ex.: [Search for it!](www.google.com)

### 5) The other link type is called a reference link. As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an example of what we mean:

#### Here's [a link to something else][another place].
#### Here's [yet another link][another-link].
#### And now back to [the first link][another place].

#### [another place]: www.github.com
#### [another-link]: www.google.com
